# Data Analyst Portfolio - Mauricio Ramirez

Hello there!

I'm Mauricio, an aspiring **Data Analyst** passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful insights that drive smart decisions. 
This repository showcases a collection of data analysis projects that demonstrate my growing skills in **data cleaning**, **exploration**, **visualization**, **statistical analysis**, and **storytelling**.

I created this space to document my learning journey, apply theoretical knowledge to real-world datasets, and continuously sharpen my analytical thinking, using tools like **Python**, **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Tableau**.

## The Intersection of Indigenous Identity and Educational Attainment in Mexico
This data analytics project aims to explore the distribution of the population in Mexico that either speaks an indigenous language or belongs to an indigenous household, and analyze how this demographic characteristic correlates with levels of education and illiteracy. Indigenous populations in Mexico represent a vital part of the country’s cultural heritage, yet they often face systemic inequalities, including disparities in access to education.

Using publicly available census and survey data from the mexican National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), this project investigates spatial, demographic, and educational trends among indigenous communities. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns in indigenous language usage across different states and regions, and quantifies the relationship between these factors and educational attainment.

By visualizing and modeling this relationship, the project seeks to provide insights into how ethnicity and language are associated with educational outcomes in Mexico. These insights can inform policymakers, researchers, and social organizations aiming to reduce educational inequality and support the inclusion and empowerment of indigenous populations.

## Comparing Inflation Trends Across European Union Countries

The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the evolution of inflation across European Union (EU) countries over time, focusing on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). This study will identify long-term and short-term trends in inflation, highlight major economic shifts, and uncover patterns that indicate stability or volatility among member states.​

A special emphasis will be placed on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on inflation dynamics — examining how different economies were affected during 2020–2022, the nature and duration of inflationary pressures, and the trajectory of recovery. The study will compare inflation trends before, during, and after the pandemic to assess economic resilience.

CSV Data Preprocessing App

Streamlit app designed to perform comprehensive data preprocessing for machine learning workflows. It handles tasks such as missing value imputation, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and outlier detection. The tool provides an interactive interface for users to upload datasets, apply transformations, and export the cleaned data for modeling. The project emphasizes automation, reproducibility, and ease of use for both beginners and data professionals.

## Modern Data Warehousing with SQL Server
This project involves the design and implementation of a modern data warehouse using **Microsoft SQL Server**, encompassing the full data pipeline—from **ETL processes** (Extract, Transform, Load) to data modeling and analytics. The goal was to build a robust and scalable architecture that enables efficient data integration and insightful analysis.

The project was developed by following the comprehensive YouTube tutorial series by **Baraa** (available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GVqKuTVANE&list=PLNcg_FV9n7qZ4Ym8ZriYT6WF8TaC2e_R7&index=4)). Baraa’s extensive and hands-on tutorial walks you through each step of the process in a clear and detailed manner, helping you not only build the solution but truly understand the reasoning behind each component—be it in staging data, designing fact and dimension tables, or building analytical queries and reports.

The final solution includes:  
* **Staging and data cleansing** using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
* **Dimensional modeling** with star schema design
* Implementation of **ETL workflows** for loading data from raw sources into the warehouse
* Use of **SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)** and **SQL queries** to generate business insights
