# 🎓 The Intersection of Indigenous Identity and Educational Attainment in Mexico 🇲🇽

This data analytics project aims to explore the distribution of the population in Mexico that either speaks an indigenous language or identifies 
as indigenous, and analyze how this demographic characteristic correlates with levels of education and illiteracy. Indigenous populations in Mexico represent a vital part of the country’s cultural heritage, yet they often face systemic inequalities, including disparities in access to education.

Using publicly available census and survey data from national statistical institutions (INEGI), this project investigates spatial, 
demographic, and educational trends among indigenous communities. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns in indigenous language usage and self-identification across different states and regions, and quantifies the relationship between these factors and educational attainment.

By visualizing and modeling this relationship, the project seeks to provide insights into how ethnicity and language are associated with educational outcomes in Mexico. These insights can inform policymakers, researchers, and social organizations aiming to reduce educational inequality and support the inclusion and empowerment of indigenous populations.
