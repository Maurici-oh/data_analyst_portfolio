# Modern Data Warehousing with SQL Server

This project involves the design and implementation of a modern data warehouse using **Microsoft SQL Server**, encompassing the full data pipeline‚Äîfrom **ETL processes** (Extract, Transform, Load) to data modeling and analytics. The goal was to build a robust and scalable architecture that enables efficient data integration and insightful analysis.

The project was developed by following the comprehensive YouTube tutorial series by **Baraa** (available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GVqKuTVANE&list=PLNcg_FV9n7qZ4Ym8ZriYT6WF8TaC2e_R7&index=4)). Baraa‚Äôs extensive and hands-on tutorial walks you through each step of the process in a clear and detailed manner, helping you not only build the solution but truly understand the reasoning behind each component‚Äîbe it in staging data, designing fact and dimension tables, or building analytical queries and reports.

The final solution includes:  
* **Staging and data cleansing** using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
* **Dimensional modeling** with star schema design
* Implementation of **ETL workflows** for loading data from raw sources into the warehouse
* Use of **SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)** and **SQL queries** to generate business insights

This project provided a solid foundation in practical data warehousing concepts, using real-world examples to reinforce best practices in data architecture and analytics.

## üéØ Objectives
* Design and implement a modern data warehouse using Microsoft SQL Server to support efficient data integration, storage, and analysis.
* Understand and apply ETL processes (Extract, Transform, Load) to move and cleanse data from source systems into a structured warehouse environment.
* Develop a dimensional data model (star schema) that supports analytical queries and reporting, focusing on performance and scalability.
* Gain hands-on experience with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for automating data loading and transformation workflows.
* Leverage SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) and SQL queries to extract meaningful business insights from the data.
* Follow best practices in data architecture and warehousing, as demonstrated in Baraa‚Äôs detailed tutorial series.
* Build foundational knowledge in data warehousing concepts that can be applied to real-world business intelligence and analytics scenarios.

## üìã Specifications

* **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
* **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
* **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
* **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholderd and analytics teams.
