# 💶 Comparing Inflation Trends Across European Union Countries 📈

The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the **evolution of inflation across European Union (EU) 
countries over time**, focusing on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). This study will identify long-term
and short-term trends in inflation, highlight major economic shifts, and uncover patterns that indicate stability or
volatility among member states.​

A special emphasis will be placed on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on inflation dynamics — examining how
different economies were affected during 2020–2022, the nature and duration of inflationary pressures, and the
trajectory of recovery. The study will compare inflation trends before, during, and after the pandemic to assess
economic resilience.

## 💡 Findings and Conclusions
The analysis of inflation trends across European Union countries reveals a pronounced spike in inflation around October 2022. The data suggests 
that this surge was not random but likely linked to significant global events. The COVID‑19 pandemic disrupted supply chains, altered consumer 
behavior, and strained labor markets, creating upward pressure on prices. Subsequently, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 exacerbated 
inflationary pressures by driving up energy and food costs, particularly affecting European economies dependent on imports from the region. Together, 
these events formed a dual shock that amplified existing economic vulnerabilities, leading to the sharp inflation peak observed. Understanding these 
connections underscores the importance of resilience in economic policy and international cooperation to mitigate the effects of future crises.
